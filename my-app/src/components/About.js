            I am currently studying to become a Full Stack Developer.Mostly
             I really enjoy making Front-End applications,
             I think It helps me with my creative outlet and helps me express myself. 
             I like working in the Back-End as well, 
             but I belive I need a lot more practice to feel confident in that area!
             Before I started my journey as a Full Stack Developer,
             I was an audio engineer and music producer. I have been working with music for a while now,
             but I decided to change my career path and start something new!
